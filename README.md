# Aura

**Aura** is an experimental Unreal Engine project developed by [Shamsul Arifin](https://github.com/ShamsulArifin). The repository contains source code and configuration files for building and deploying the project across various platforms, including HoloLens.

## Project Overview

This project leverages Unreal Engine to create immersive experiences, with a particular focus on augmented reality (AR) applications. The inclusion of HoloLens-specific configurations suggests an emphasis on AR development.

## Repository Structure

* **`Aura.uproject`**: The main Unreal Engine project file.
* **`Source/`**: Contains the C++ source code for the project.
* **`Config/`**: Houses configuration files for the project.
* **`Platforms/HoloLens/Config/`**: Platform-specific configurations tailored for HoloLens deployment.
* **`.idea/`**: Project settings for JetBrains IDEs like Rider or CLion.

## Technologies Used

* **Unreal Engine**: The primary game engine used for development.
* **C++**: Main programming language for the project's source code.
* **C#**: Used for scripting and possibly editor extensions.
* **HoloLens**: Target platform for AR experiences.
